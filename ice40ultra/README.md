This is a sample project meant for the [ice40ultra breakout board](http://www.latticesemi.com/en/Products/DevelopmentBoardsAndKits/iCE40UltraBreakoutBoard.aspx)

The high powered white led is controlled by hardware and blinks roughly once per second,
the RBG led is controlled by software by writing to the address 0x00010000. The lower
24 bits are used to produce a colour on the LED.

There is also a uart in the software. I use this [PmodUSBUART](https://digilentinc.com/Products/Detail.cfm?NavPath=2,401,928&Prod=PMOD-USB-UART)
chip to connecto to it. The rxd pin is connected to pin B2 on the board (listed
as txd in the pcf file). To control the uart from software see softare/main.c
for an example.

To build the software, make sure you have the [riscv-gnu-toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain)
in your path. Then run `make build-software` from this directory.


To build you need the ICEcube2 toolchain from Lattice Semiconductor installed.
Then run the command `make ICECUBE2=${ICECUBE2_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY} bit`
(note that this depends on test.mem which is generated by `make build-software` )
